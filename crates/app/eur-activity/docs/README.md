# eur-activity Documentation

## Overview
The `eur-activity` crate provides timeline storage for capturing system state over time within the Eurora application. It implements a strategy pattern for handling different types of user activities, with specialized support for browser-based content tracking.

### üìã [Critical Issues Analysis](./critical-issues-analysis.md)
Comprehensive analysis of critical issues that need immediate attention, including:
- Compilation failures and TODO implementations
- Error handling and stability issues
- Performance and memory concerns
- Security and configuration problems

**Key Findings:**
- Multiple `todo!()` implementations causing runtime panics
- Extensive use of `expect()` and `unwrap()` leading to crashes
- Missing timestamp implementations in snapshots
- Performance and memory concerns with image handling

### üèóÔ∏è [Architecture Overview](./architecture-overview.md)
Detailed architectural documentation covering:
- Core components and design patterns
- Data flow and integration points
- Strategy pattern implementation
- Protocol buffer communication
- LLM and UI integration

**Key Components:**
- [`ActivityStrategy`](../src/lib.rs:171) trait for different activity types
- [`BrowserStrategy`](../src/browser_activity.rs:287) for browser content tracking
- [`ActivityAsset`](../src/lib.rs:43) and [`ActivitySnapshot`](../src/lib.rs:53) traits for data modeling
- gRPC communication with browser extensions

### üõ£Ô∏è [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md)
Prioritized development plan organized in phases:

#### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (1-2 weeks)
- Implement all TODO methods
- Replace panic-prone error handling
- Add proper timestamp tracking

#### Phase 2: Core Functionality (2-3 weeks)
- Comprehensive error handling with timeouts
- Dynamic asset naming and metadata
- Asset processing pipeline documentation

#### Phase 3: Performance & Reliability (3-4 weeks)
- Memory management and image optimization
- Asset type registry and processing pipeline
- Concurrency improvements
- Monitoring and observability

#### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (2-3 weeks)
- Comprehensive test suite (80% coverage target)
- Performance benchmarks
- Complete API documentation

### üß™ [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md)
Comprehensive testing approach including:
- Unit tests for all trait implementations
- Integration tests for gRPC communication
- Performance tests for memory and timing
- Concurrency and thread safety validation

**Quality Targets:**
- 80% minimum code coverage
- Sub-5-second asset collection
- Maximum 100MB memory per activity
- 99.9% reliability for normal operations

## Quick Start

### Current Status
‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** The crate currently has critical issues preventing safe operation due to incomplete implementations. See [Critical Issues Analysis](./critical-issues-analysis.md) for details.

### Prerequisites
- Rust 2024 edition
- Protocol buffer compiler (protoc)
- Browser extension for content tracking

### Basic Usage (After Fixes)
```rust
use eur_activity::{select_strategy_for_process, Activity};

// Select appropriate strategy for a browser process
let strategy = select_strategy_for_process(
    "firefox",
    "Firefox Browser".to_string(),
    "base64_icon_data".to_string()
).await?;

// Create activity and collect assets
let mut activity = Activity::new(
    "Web Browsing".to_string(),
    "base64_icon".to_string(),
    "firefox".to_string(),
    vec![]
);

// Retrieve assets from the strategy
let assets = strategy.retrieve_assets().await?;
activity.assets = assets;
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- All new code must include unit tests
- Error handling must use `Result` types, not panics
- Public APIs must have comprehensive documentation
- All async operations must have timeout handling

### Performance Requirements
- Asset collection should complete within 5 seconds
- Memory usage should not exceed 100MB per activity
- Image processing should not block the main thread
- gRPC calls should have 10-second timeouts

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
- All error paths must be tested
- Performance tests for memory and timing
- Integration tests for external dependencies

## Integration Points

### Browser Extensions
The crate communicates with browser extensions via gRPC to collect:
- YouTube video transcripts and frames (extension ID: `7c7b59bb-d44d-431a-9f4d-64240172e092`)
- Article content and metadata (extension ID: `None` for fallback processing)
- PDF annotations and highlights

Extension IDs are intentionally hardcoded as they identify specific asset processing pipelines within the application architecture.

### LLM Integration
Activities and assets are converted to LLM message format for AI processing:
- Text content for articles
- Image content with transcripts for videos
- Context chips for UI representation

### Database Integration
Future integration with `eur-personal-db` for:
- Activity persistence
- Timeline storage
- Search and filtering capabilities
