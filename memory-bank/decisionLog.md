# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.
2025-04-25 21:14:22 - Initial creation of Memory Bank.
2025-04-25 21:18:12 - Improvements to launcher components.

## Decision

* Created Memory Bank to maintain project context and track development progress
* Structured Memory Bank with five core files: productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, and systemPatterns.md
* Improved launcher components with several enhancements to fix bugs and improve user experience

## Rationale

* A Memory Bank provides persistent context across different sessions and modes
* Structured documentation helps maintain clarity about project goals, progress, and decisions
* Enables more effective collaboration and knowledge transfer
* Fixing bugs and improving user experience in the launcher components enhances the overall application quality
* Implementing proper auto-scroll functionality ensures users can see new messages as they arrive
* Adding delete functionality for activity badges gives users more control over their interface

## Implementation Details

* Created memory-bank directory at the root of the project
* Populated initial files with basic project information derived from repository structure
* Set up structure for ongoing updates as the project evolves
* Made the following improvements to launcher components:
  * Fixed auto-scroll functionality by adding a proper class and setTimeout approach
  * Implemented delete functionality for activity badges using array splicing
  * Cleaned up commented-out code to improve maintainability
  * Fixed duplicate function call in API key form
  * Used consistent event handling approaches across components
