## Database Implementation Decisions

[2025-04-28 17:17:30] - Implemented SQLite as the database engine for personal data

**Decision:** Used SQLite for storing personal data including activities, video frames, and text extracted from OCR.

**Rationale:**
- SQLite is well-suited for embedded applications and desktop software
- Lightweight with zero configuration and server-less operation
- Robust transaction support with ACID compliance
- Good performance for the expected data volume
- Cross-platform compatibility aligns with Tauri's multi-platform approach

**Implementation Details:**
- Created explicit relationships in the database schema (activity â†’ activity_asset, etc.)
- Used UUID strings as primary keys for all tables to ensure uniqueness
- Added indexes on foreign keys to improve query performance
- Implemented a Rust interface with SQLX for type-safe database access
- Added comprehensive API for common database operations
- Used ISO8601 format for datetime fields to ensure compatibility
2025-04-25 21:18:12 - Improvements to launcher components.
2025-04-28 13:53:00 - Fixed async/await issue in OCR service.

## Decision

* Created Memory Bank to maintain project context and track development progress
* Structured Memory Bank with five core files: productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, and systemPatterns.md
* Improved launcher components with several enhancements to fix bugs and improve user experience
* Fixed async/await issue in OCR service by properly handling futures

## Rationale

* A Memory Bank provides persistent context across different sessions and modes
* Structured documentation helps maintain clarity about project goals, progress, and decisions
* Enables more effective collaboration and knowledge transfer
* Fixing bugs and improving user experience in the launcher components enhances the overall application quality
* Implementing proper auto-scroll functionality ensures users can see new messages as they arrive
* Adding delete functionality for activity badges gives users more control over their interface
* Properly handling async/await in OCR service ensures correct processing of image recognition requests

## Implementation Details

* Created memory-bank directory at the root of the project
* Populated initial files with basic project information derived from repository structure
* Set up structure for ongoing updates as the project evolves
* Made the following improvements to launcher components:
  * Fixed auto-scroll functionality by adding a proper class and setTimeout approach
  * Implemented delete functionality for activity badges using array splicing
  * Cleaned up commented-out code to improve maintainability
  * Fixed duplicate function call in API key form
  * Used consistent event handling approaches across components
* Fixed OCR service by:
  * Adding futures crate as a dependency
  * Properly collecting futures into a vector
  * Using futures::future::join_all to await all futures concurrently
# Decision Log

This file tracks key architectural and design decisions made during the project's development.
2025-04-25 21:14:27 - Initial creation of Memory Bank.

[2025-05-14 18:53:02] - Implemented Context Chip component

**Decision:** Created a reusable Context Chip component based on the styling from Transcript.svelte.

**Rationale:**
- Extracted styling from Transcript.svelte to create a reusable component
- Implemented as a UI component following the same pattern as the Badge component
- Added variants to support different use cases (default, primary, secondary, destructive, outline)
- Included support for click handlers and links
- Used backdrop blur effect for a modern, translucent appearance

**Implementation Details:**
- Created component in packages/ui/src/custom-components/ui/context-chip
- Used tailwind-variants (tv) for variant styling
- Added proper TypeScript typing for variants
- Exported component in the main UI package index.ts
- Created documentation page in the docs app
